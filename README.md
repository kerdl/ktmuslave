# KTMU slave
### A bot for schedule from https://ktmu-sutd.ru/

- Both for [VK](https://vk.com/ktmuslave) and [Telegram](https://t.me/ktmuslave_bot) with same codebase using custom generic handlers
- Easy step-by-step registration
- Easy paginated editable storage for each user for teachers' Zoom data to show it in schedule
- Broadcast on schedule change with detailed comparison, replying to the last message and optional pinning in chat
- Ability to force update schedule globally if someone noticed a change between the 10 min update period
- Miscellaneous useful links in schedule message: **original schedules**, **teachers' materials** and **grades**

### What about parsing part?
[**ktmuscrap**](https://github.com/kerdl/ktmuscrap) is a parsing HTTP REST API server written in ðŸš€BLAZINGLY FAST HIT VIDEO GAME - RUSTðŸš€

Server runs on localhost, providing simple API for this bot, such as:
- getting **daily** or **weekly** schedule's JSON both **fully** or **for specific group to ðŸš€SAVE EXTRA MILLISECONDðŸš€**
- force update with a POST request if user pressed the **Update** button
- subscription to update events using WebSocket, which sends all detailed schedule changes
